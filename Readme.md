# Pathfinder Adventures

This is a repository of adventures compatible with the Pathfinder Role Playing Game.

I'm, at best, a rank amateur game designer and author. I make no guarantees that these are well balanced, fair, or in any way well designed. This is a great place to put my stuff out there for other people to find, though, and perhaps it will help someone else.  

If you have comments on how to make an adventure here better, please feel free to submit an issue. If you have a change to an error, or a way to improve the formatting or content, hit me up with a pull request.

Let's play!
