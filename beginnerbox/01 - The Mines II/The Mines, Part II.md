# The Mines, Part II

## 1) Partial Cave In
   **(XP: 500)**

> The cart tracks you've been following disappear under rubble from the caved in wall on the southwest side, then reappear as it curves to the north, all the while sloping downward.  It's still passable, but you'll be down to a single file. You could spend a few minutes and clear enough of it to make your way easier, though.  

The rubble in this section is balanced precariously, and will slide into the hallway if disturbed too much.  This includes moving it, or walking through it.  However, if the characters examine the rubble first, making a DC 15 Perception or Knowledge (Dungeoneering) check, they'll realize that the rubble is unstable.  They can then safely set it off to collapse, or move rubble out of the way as neccessary.  The rubble deals 1d4 damage to anyone caught in the slide.

Once the party starts clearing the rubble, two giant centipedes slither out through the rubble, and attack, thinking that the party is after their nest.

## 2) Main cave 
  **(XP: 680)**
> The cart tracks continue down the hallway to the north.  After about 25', it opens into a natural cave.  

> The old miners here obviously used this cave as a central hub, but it's taken the brunt of the earthquake.  Thick timbers that used to brace the ceiling have fallen, amongst rubble fallen from above.  A rotten minecard has collapsed in on itself to the side.  Mineshafts have been dug to the east, with natural looking passages to the west and north, but rubble and timbers clog the way to the north, where the passage has collapsed completely.

> As you step in, you hear the clatter of bones, and the sound of a creature gnawing. Just past the fallen timber, a ghoul tears at the flesh of a rat while two skeletons shuffle around. It seems that at least some of the miners didn't rest easily when they were killed. 

> The ghoul stops, looks up, and drops the rat as it sees you. 

The rubble in the center of the room is passable, but counts as rough terrain, halving any movement over it.  

Buried under the rubble there is an onyx gem with a permanent light spell cast on it. The gem is cracked, making it worthless in and of itself, but the permanant light source is valuable.

## 3) Natural passageway

> Twisting and turning deeper into the ground, this passage way begins to narrow significantly as you progress.  At first you can easily walk two abreast, then to single file, until you're squeezing through.

> As you pass through the third twist in the corridor, you realize that you can hear a rushing sound.  At first, you think it's just water... but it's getting louder than it should be, if you were just marching towards it.

> ** BATS! **

As the party approaches the room ahead, allow them to make perception rolls.  If they beat DC 15, they will hear the bats stirring in the cavern ahead over the sound of the water, and can make preparations (i.e. crouch down, etc).  Otherwise, a DC 15 Will save must be made to avoid panicking and fleeing back the way that they came as the swarm encompasses the party.


## 4) Watery cave / grave

> The last of the bats clears as you squeeze through the end of the tight passageway, into a natural cave.  You realize that the sound that you heard actually was water!  A rushing stream cascades over an outcropping here, into a deep pool.  It laps at the stony beach you stand on, but doesn't fill the cave; it must flow out of the pool somewhere below.  The light of your torch glitters off the natural crystals that have formed over many years here.  Stactites reach down from the ceiling, like teeth before the stream.

> The water itself is very clear.  Looking into it, you can see that an outcropping plateaus about halfway down, about 20 feet.  Sitting on it, are what looks like the bones of creatures that have stumbled into the pool.  Most look like small creatures that likely rode down the stream from the surface.  

This pool is home to a giant anemone, anchored very far down the pool, near the natural exit of the stream.  It's latched itself here, and survives off the creatures that stumble into the pool.  It remains anchored, but when a creature gets close enough, it will slither a tenacle up to try and grab and pull the hapless victim down. Once its digested it, it will push the bones away, and they will often be deposited on the plateau.  

Most of the skeletons on the plateau are indeed small animals, however, one skeleton sticks out from the rest, if the characters can make a DC 10 perception check.  It is the skeleton of another unlucky adventurer that fell victim to the anemone.  It has a bottle clutched in one hand, a dagger in the other, and a sack tied to its rusty armour.  These are:

	- a bottle of air
	- a +1 dagger
	- a bag of holding

The bag of holding doesn't contain anything but water.

If the characters decide that they want to attempt to retrieve the items, a DC 10 swim check is neccessary. It will take them two rounds to free everything from the skeleton, and the anemone will attack in the second round.  It's not interested in fighting though... the first hit that does any damage will make it loose its grip, freeing its captive. (It's not used to its lunches fighting back!)


## 5) An odd approach
> This passageway slopes downwards.  It appears as if it were dug in an attempt to go deeper into the mine, as it's quite wide, and relatively even.  It doesn't take a dwarf to realize, though, to realize that something is odd about it.  After about _______ feet, it levels off, and the carved walls take on a different look.  It's almost as if they went from using tools, to using something magical.  

> Up ahead, you can see a soft glow.  


## 6) Puzzle / Portal
> Stepping into the room, you can immediately see the source of the glowing.  It's structure in the corner of the room!  Adorned in runes, there are two recessions or recepticals.  Symbols over top of each look as if they might represent something.  

> A small, stone table leans against the side of the wall, broken and askew.  A pile of papers lays on the floor where they slid off the table when it broke, and a couple of brass candlesticks have rolled away.  It might have broken in the earthquake, many years ago.  

The papers are mostly unreadable, save but a few scribblings.  A name at the top of one of the pages is still legible, "Bargle".  Another page has the words "to activate, cast c".  The rest are illegible.

The portal belongs to a wizard named, as you may have guessed, Bargle.  It has remained unused since the earthquake.  With investigation, and a Knowledge (Arcana) check of DC 12, the PCs can decipher the pictograms above the recessions.  The one of the left of the opening depicts an arcane fire symbol, and the right, cold.  Casting a spell of the respective type into the recepticals activates the portal:

> For a moment, you wonder if the spells worked.  Then you feel something, a humming, before you hear it. Then with a POP, the space between the recepticals fills with purple mist, and you can see through, although barely, into an area that was NOT there before!

When the portal is activated, the PCs will hear a woman quietly singing to herself, as if concentrating on something.  Then, it will stop, and voice will say 

> "Oh! I wasn't expecting you to open.  Where are you... "

> Footsteps tap across a floor on the other side, and a figure strides into view.  "Oh, no. No, no, no.  This won't do.  I thought that the earthquake would have disabled you!  Whoever activated you must be very weak, however.  This barely has enough power to transfer an image!"

> The figure reaches out and touches something on her side of the portal, and the purple mist dissappates.  However, within moments, the humming you felt when you activated it is back, but much stronger, and louder.  A rush of air pushes you backwards a step, and a strong steady passageway appears.  The woman is gone from view, but you hear her continue to speak.  

> "There. Now, to take care of you.  I'm not ready yet, and I can't tolerate any further interruptions.  You there! Go through and dimantle the portal on the other side, then deactivate."

> A deep, growling voice, like metal on metal, rumbles, "Yes mistress," and pounding footsteps lumber towards the gate. An imposing figure stops momentarily, then steps through. It's solid iron, and it turns and starts pounding on the gate!

This is an iron golem. It's not as tall as a full size iron golem, but nearly as wide as the portal itself.  It will ignore all attacks against it, except for the first one. That PC will be hit with enough force to throw them across the room, bringing them to -20 hitpoints immediately. (They'll need to be brought back using the Scroll of New Life, if the PCs still have it.)

Once the golem is done dismantling the portal, it immediately shuts itself down. At first, it seems still, but within moments, and great heat begins to radiate from it.  Anyone within 10' takes 1d8 heat damage.  The golem itself slumps into itself, its core melted and no longer magical.  It bears a great crack in its torso, though, and with enough work, it can be opened, exposing a heart of mithral.  This ore can be used to smith a mithral weapon of longsword sized (or equivalent).  

The portal, at this point, is now a pile of rubble, and inoperable.  It no longer radiates magic, and the glow is gone.
