# The Mines, Part II

This is a continuation of the Deadly Mine adventure from the Pathfinder GM Kit.  It picks up immediately after area 5, "Sinkhole".  It features a couple of useful treasures, a couple of monsters that will be new to the players, and adventure hooks to turn this into a full fledged campaign.  It even has a way to force the players to use up the Scroll of New Life they found in the first Beginner Box adventure!
